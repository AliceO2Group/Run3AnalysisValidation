## Introduction
The main purpose of this folder is to provide analysis tools to perform analysis of O2 analysis task outputs.
It includes for the moment a set of QA plotting macros to inspect `AnalysisResults.root` of MC and data samples.
It also includes some preliminary functionalities for performing efficiency corrections of HF analyses. It is currently being used
also for performing Run5 analysis.
